## What happens when..

One of my favourite interview questions is: What happens when you type a mozilla.org in your browser's address bar?

A simple and correct answer is: An HTTP request is sent to the mozilla.org servers and they send a web page that is displayed by the browser.

A more interesting answer can touch upon auto-completions in the address bar, DNS resolution, encryption, caches, load balancers, SSL certificates, DOMs etc.

In this session, I will try to answer the "What happens when..." question at a level that is approachable to tech-savvy non-programmers - the teachers, students and everyone in between.
